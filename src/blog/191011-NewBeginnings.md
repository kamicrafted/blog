It's been awhile since I've last kept up with publishing my musings on the web, and even though it's been on the back of my mind to give it another go, finding the time to get something off the ground has been elusive.

There's been a ton of new tools and frameworks that I've been curious to dabble in, which ended up being the motivation for me to finally buckle down and get this blog up and running.

A few of the things that I've been excited to try and figure out are:

- Using Vuepress for creating pre-rendered, static SPA
- Learn React & Framer X
- Digging deeper into Vue, Vue Router and VueX
- Getting better with Craft CMS + Commerce

Writing out what I'm learning has proved to be an effective way to commit concepts to memory while having a place to reference down the line, as well as easily share my findings with others walking a similar path of discovery.
