Happy New Year, world! I've never been much of a believer of resolutions, as I often ended up begrudgingly setting a few at the insistence of others; only to find myself giving up before spring even ends. Maybe it's been due to the sense of failure or the discomfort of facing the truth about the ineffectiveness of my ability to break bad habits and build new ones, but the last time I can remember trying to follow through on a new year resolution was around 3 years ago when I was trying to get healthier by consistently working out at home. For context, I've probably stepped foot into the gym a total of 30 days over the course of my entire lifetime, possibly even less. Needless to say, I forced myself to keep it up for a few months and then once again, drifted towards the eventual outcome of giving it up.

It must be obvious where I'm heading with this post by now, which is about my redemptive decision to once again kickstart resolutions. Before I get into the details of what they are, I wanted to share the path that brought me to reconsider and retry following through on a set of personal promises for the year.

2019 turned out to be much more challenging than expected due to the immense stress at work I was dealing with while trying to confront various personal issues that progressively became worse over the course of the year. As a result, I was finding myself in a pretty dark and unhealthy state of mind that was beginning to take its toll. Thankfully, I had decided to take 2 weeks of time off over the holidays and the new year to allow myself to disengage from work matters and create a space to start recovering from my burnout. What I didn't expect was for all three of my kids to get sick with a 103+ fever along with my wife coming down with the flu during this time, and to tip the scale further, we ended up losing our hired help that had been handling much of our day-to-day home and child care work as well.

All of these responsibilities that I otherwise normally didn't have to worry about suddenly became mine to handle – doing the dishes and the laundry, keeping the family fed for every meal, and cleaning the house to keep it in a semi-presentable state; which I quickly found out was practically impossible. Each time I took on one of these chores, it would quickly revert back to the chaotic state in which it started; washed the dishes? A new load would appear within the hour. Did the laundry? A fresh batch of soiled clothes would magically fill the hamper back up in no time. Cleaned the kitchen? My kids would make sure to hit the reset button on that as well. This continued on for several days and even though it was exhausting work to manage the house alone, I was somehow able to avoid freaking out or flipping the proverbial table in frustration.

I found this newfound sense of peace in a turbulent and demanding situation to be curious, and in the process of trying to understand why that was the case, the reason became clear to me while washing the dishes for the umpteenth time that day. I normally would have found the need to take on these various responsibilities a distraction from "more important" matters such as my work or personal development efforts. This time, however, I felt that I was doing what I wanted and needed to do because it was the most important thing to be doing. Even though I was exhausted, I was able to take it in stride and in some ways possibly enjoy the various mindless tasks for one simple reason: my expectations of the situation was aligned with the actions I was taking.

On most occassions where I found myself frustrated about something I had to do when there were other urgent matters at hand, my mind would quickly flip to the mindset of "Ugh, I have to do X when what I really need/want to do is Y."
